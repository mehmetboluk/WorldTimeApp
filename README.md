# WorldTimeApp

In this app, I' am building an android time app that will fetch, time zone list from a REST API. 


Using:

Kotlin MVVM architectural pattern, Retrofit and Room.

Json file was prepared by myself and data is fetching from local server, so local server ip address is required.

You can find Json file that i used in repository file.
